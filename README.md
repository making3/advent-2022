# Advent of Code 2021

This is my personal [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions as I go through them. Some are
partially cleaned up, some are not.

I'm doing this purely for fun and I am not interested in solving these quickly or with high performance (this is
supposed to be fun after all). In other words, don't take what I write too seriously and a bit of laziness definitely remains :).

## Running

If you would like to run any solutions, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and:

1. Clone the project
2. Run `node run.js [dayX]`
    - E.g. `node run.js day10`
